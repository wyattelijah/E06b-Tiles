Playing with the Tiled Map Editor

This is an opportunity for you to experiment with using the Tiled Map Editor to build a 2D platformer.

 * Download the Tiled Map Editor at (https://www.mapeditor.org)[https://www.mapeditor.org]. Follow the links to "Download at itch.io", click the "Download Now" button. Feel free to donate, or click the "No thanks, just take me to the downloads" link. Then download the version appropriate for your computer.
 * In this repository, you will find a map.tmx file. This is set up with some initial tiles (in the assets folder) for you to create an orthogonal map. Open map.tmx in Tiled.
 * map.tmx has two layers, Platforms and Coins. Anything you draw in Platforms will be an object to stand on or an obstacle; anything you draw in Coins will be a source of points.
 * Use the stamp brush to add tiles from the Terrain Tool to your map. When you are happy with the layout, save the file.
 * open and run main1.py. You should see a character that you can move and cause to jump in the map you have drawn; you should be able to use the character to collect coins.
 * repeat until you are happy with your platformer level. If you wish to change the dimensions of the map, select the Map->Map Properties menu item and adjust the width and height of the file.
